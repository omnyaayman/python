# 🍔 Food Delivery Data Analysis  
A simple but well-structured Python project that analyzes sample food delivery data such as delivery times, ratings, and prices.  
The project is designed for practicing Python fundamentals, clean code structure, and data analysis basics.

## ⭐ Project Overview
This project contains a small dataset of food delivery orders from different restaurants.  
We analyze the data to extract insights such as:

- ✔ Total number of orders  
- ✔ Average delivery time  
- ✔ Fastest and slowest delivery  
- ✔ Average customer rating  
- ✔ Average order price  

The project is organized into multiple Python modules to follow clean and scalable architecture.
